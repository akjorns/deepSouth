# Scrollytelling Project

## Credits

### Template Creators
This project is based on the [svelte-scrolly](https://github.com/ONSvisual/svelte-scrolly) template by [ONS Visual](https://github.com/ONSvisual), which features several component-based media in which I used the scatter plot made with Svelte. The `<Scroller/>` component used in this project is based on [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris), the creator of Svelte.

### Kode With Klossy
Additional structure and project setup were influenced by the Kode With Klossy scrollytelling template.

### Debugging
Debugging support was provided through the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT.

## My Contributions
I worked in the config.js, app.svelte, scroller.svelte, and section.svelte to make several scenes depicting the correlation between poverty and education that espicially impacts the Deep South. I worked with and understood intersection observer API and embedded d3 graphs helping me to gain a deeper understanding of the data I was working with.
